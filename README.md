DevMountain JavaScript Koans
=================
This purpose of this repository is to introduce you to Test Driven Development fundamentals and more importantly, introduce you to JavaScript fundamentals. You will be presented with a group of failing tests. Your task is to look at the test, see what it's testing, and make that test pass. Don't just guess - really try to understand the JavaScript principle that is being applied to make that particular test pass.

1. Fork this repository
2. Observe the files in the 'koans' folder. You'll notice each file is testing for some particular piece of knowledge, whether it be Arrays, Objects, Functions, etc.
3. Open up KoansRunner.html in your Web Browser and observe that it shows one failing test. To see all the tests that are failing, click on 'look ahead'. This will show you every test in the test suite. 
4. The most outer text in the red box is the particular section you're in, in from that is the particular test, and inside that box in the gray area is what the test suite is expecting to happen. In this case the test suite is expecting 'false to be Truthy'. Inside that box you'll notice which file the test is failing at, AboutExpects.js
5. Navigate to AboutExpects.js and make all those tests pass to get a feel for how TDD (test driven development) works.
6. Once you make all those tests pass, notice that those particular tests go green, and now the most outer text is now different - because we've moved on to a different section. Keep working to pass all the tests. Be sure to commit and push to your fork often, it's good practice.
